Plumbing Commands
=================

VirtualZ includes a few commands which are “hidden”: they do not show in
the output of “vz help” and are not offered as candidates for completion.
These commands are intended to be used as an aid to write scripts which
make use of VirtualZ. All the commands are prefixed with an underscore.

_exists <name>
--------------

Checks whether a virtualenv “<name>” exists. The exit status is non-zero
if the virtualenv is missing.
