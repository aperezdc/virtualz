The VirtualZ home directory
===========================

Each virtualenv is stored in a subdirectory of the home directory. The
variable ${VIRTUALZ_HOME} defines the path to the home directory. If not
overriden, its default value is "~/.virtualenvs". To configure a custom
path, define the variable in your "~/.zshrc":

  VIRTUALZ_HOME=/path/to/virtualenvs

The variable does not need to be exported, and it will be honored regardless
of whether it has been defined before or after sourcing VirtualZ. This means
that you can redefine ${VIRTUALZ_HOME} from an interactive shell, but note
that setting the home directory while a virtualenv is active is unsupported.
