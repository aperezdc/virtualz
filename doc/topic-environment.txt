Environment Variables
=====================

VirtualZ uses the following environtment variables:

* VIRTUALZ_HOME: Path to the home directory where virtualenvs are kept.
  (Use "vz help homedir" for more information.)

* VIRTUAL_ENV: Path to the active virtualenv. Undefined if no virtualenv
  is active.

* VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME: Name of the active virtualenv. Undefined if no virtualenv
  is active. This is always the last path component of ${VIRTUAL_ENV}, with
  trailing slashes removed, and it is provided as a convenience.
